        <h2>A Point-and-Click Murder Mystery</h2>
        <p>
            While everyone at the rich person cocktail studio apartment party was watching the Game of Thrones finale,
            the host, Frank Frankard, had been found dead! On the floor! Like right behind the couch!</p>
        <p> The guests: His Fiancee, a one eyed coworker, his brother, and Tito were unaware of his departure until you
            wanted a refill!</p>
        <p>"FRANK!! I don't know how to get ice out of your fridge!", as you turn around you found him lying on the
            floor!</p>
        <p>Can you find out who killed him?</p>
