        Co worker is killer, and used poisoned to kill host (frank). He got poison mixed up with his normal eyedrops, so he poisoned his eye which is why he needed the eye patch.

        Fiance's name is Penelope, the poisonous eye drops have a P on it, hinting P for penelope instead of P for poison when looking at the poisonous eye drops.
